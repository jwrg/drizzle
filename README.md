# Drizzle
Pi-plates and Flask to make it rain.
## Overview
This is a small Flask web app for controlling sprinklers
in conjunction with a Pi-Plates RELAYplate.  It is intended
for home use only and is provided with NO WARRANTY.  USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK.  That having been said, please use.
## Installation
Clone this repo, then run setup.sh or just read it to get
the gist of what you need to do to get wet.
## Configuration
Just read the code and set some constants, it's not a big
codebase nor is there a lot for the user to set.
## Usage
When on the same network as the RPi, point your phone at
its address (on port 80) to turn sprinkler zones on and
off.
